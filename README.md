# Audio_Signal_Processing
This repository demonstrates the generation and analysis of audio signals using Python. It includes scripts to generate sinusoidal tones, create composite signals, and perform Fourier Transform to visualize frequency components. Key tools used are NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for signal synthesis and spectral analysis.
